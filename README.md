# üìù Productivity Hub

Welcome to **Productivity Hub**, a feature-rich mini productivity app designed to help users track tasks, link them to notes, and build routines ‚Äî all in one place. This app aims to make staying productive fun and engaging through gamification, including a points system that unlocks badges for completing tasks and sticking to routines.

This project began as a Next.js take-home challenge deployed on AWS Amplify but is evolving into an app featuring modern libraries and tooling like **Dexie.js**, **Zustand**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

- **Notes Linking**: (Coming Soon) Attach notes to tasks for better context and organization.
- **Routine Builder**: (Planned) Develop daily, weekly, and monthly routines.
- **Gamification**: (Planned) Earn points for completing tasks and unlock badges to stay motivated.
- **AWS Amplify Deployment**: Fully deployed on AWS with CI/CD integration for seamless updates.

## üåü Vision for the App

### 1. **Unified Productivity Space**

A central hub where users can track tasks, add contextual notes, and design routines that keep them on track.

### 2. **Engagement Through Gamification**

Earn points for completing tasks and routines, with weekly/monthly badges to celebrate consistency.

### 3. **Accessible and Reusable**

Deployable on any AWS account with minimal configuration, allowing other developers to fork and build upon it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/productivity-hub.git
cd productivity-hub
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment on AWS Amplify

The app is fully deployable on AWS Amplify. To set up your own deployment:

### 1. **Environment Variables**

Add the following to your Amplify environment:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Your app‚Äôs NextAuth secret.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The app's deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.amplifyapp.com`).

### 2. **Build Settings**

Ensure your `amplify.yml` or `buildspec.yml` is configured to build a Next.js app:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm install
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: out
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

---

## üêû Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### 1. **Environment Variables**

Ensure all required secrets (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) are set in the Amplify environment.

### 2. **Next.js Configuration**

- Ensure your `next.config.js` is properly formatted. AWS Amplify doesn‚Äôt support `next.config.ts`.
- Use the correct target output: `export` for static deployment or `server` for dynamic features.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Notes Integration**: Link notes to tasks.
- [ ] **Routine Tracker**: Add support for routines (daily, weekly, monthly).
- [ ] **Gamification**: Implement a points system and badges.
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Secure user sessions with NextAuth.js.
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Further enhance usability across all devices.
- [ ] **Cloud Syncing**: Sync tasks and routines across devices using AWS services.

---

## üß© Reusability for Other AWS Accounts

To make the app deployable on any AWS account:

1. Configure secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager** or Amplify‚Äôs environment variables.
2. Use dynamic configuration in `next.config.js` to adapt based on the deployment environment.
3. Leverage Amplify‚Äôs CI/CD pipelines to handle builds automatically on push to your GitHub repository.
